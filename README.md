# **TNBC AI Early Detection Project**

## **Overview**

This project is designed to provide an AI-powered solution for the early detection of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). By combining machine learning algorithms with user-friendly interface components, it aims to predict the risk of TNBC based on key health parameters, enabling early intervention and informed decisions for both patients and healthcare professionals. This application is not intended for medical use but serves as a research and awareness tool.

## **Features**

- **AI-Powered Risk Prediction**: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier model trained on a synthetic dataset to predict the risk of TNBC based on user input.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Provides an interactive web interface where users can input key health parameters like age, family history, and symptoms to get personalized TNBC risk predictions.
- **Predictive Form**: The app uses a form-based interface where users can select answers to various health-related questions, making it easy to collect data and receive results.
- **Real-Time Deployment with Ngrok**: The app is deployed online using Ngrok, allowing access to the app through a public URL.

## **Vision**

My vision for this project is to create an accessible, easy-to-use tool that empowers individuals to understand their health and make informed decisions about their breast cancer risk. The goal is to take this project to the next level by leveraging real clinical data, integrating multi-omics insights, and working towards real-time early detection that can be adopted by medical professionals globally. I dream of contributing to the global fight against breast cancer by making early detection more accessible and actionable, thus helping save lives.

## **What’s Next**

In the future, I plan to:
- **Integrate Real-World Data**: Transition from synthetic datasets to real clinical datasets for more accurate and reliable predictions.
- **Add More Features**: Incorporate more advanced machine learning models and explainability features to improve interpretability for both clinicians and patients.
- **Build Mobile App**: Create a mobile version of the app to reach more users, especially in remote areas where access to healthcare may be limited.
- **Extend to Other Cancer Types**: Expand the app to detect multiple cancer types, leveraging similar techniques for early diagnosis across various cancers.

## **Strengths**

- **Simplicity**: The app is easy to use and provides instant results, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Ngrok integration ensures that the app is easily accessible online, allowing anyone with the link to use it.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit provides an interactive, user-friendly interface that allows for a seamless user experience.
- **Scalability**: The model and app can be scaled to include additional features or expanded to other forms of cancer detection.

## **Limitations**

- **Synthetic Data**: Currently, the model is trained on synthetic data, which limits its accuracy and generalizability to real-world clinical applications.
- **Not for Medical Use**: The app is not intended for actual medical diagnoses and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.
- **Limited Features**: The app currently uses only basic user inputs. To improve prediction accuracy, additional variables and more sophisticated machine learning techniques will be needed.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Integration of Multi-Omics Data**: Incorporating genetic, proteomic, and imaging data could significantly improve the model's predictive power.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to provide feedback on predictions to improve the model iteratively.
- **Clinical Trials and Partnerships**: Collaborating with healthcare institutions and clinical trials could help refine the app and bring it closer to real-world application.

## **Dreams and Aspirations**

I aspire for this project to be just the beginning of a revolution in early cancer detection. My dream is to scale it to a platform that serves as a reliable, real-time assistant for both patients and doctors, capable of detecting multiple forms of cancer with high precision. I aim for this technology to become a tool that’s integrated into everyday healthcare, helping to reduce cancer-related mortality rates through early detection and intervention.

Ultimately, I envision a future where AI can significantly improve healthcare accessibility, making it easier for everyone, regardless of location or socio-economic status, to receive high-quality diagnostic support. With this project, I hope to make a meaningful contribution to that future.
